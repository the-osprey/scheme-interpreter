# scheme-interpreter
Fully functioning interpreter created for Scheme language (Lisp dialect). Done 
for Berkeley CS Program Dev Course in 2017 (sixty one a). It's a pretty beautiful language, with support for things from lambdas to streams. You can do some pretty cool data structure stuff as well, primarily via linked lists. 


This is pretty easy to run. Clone the repo to a folder on your computer. Navigate to this folder in your terminal and run the following:
python3 scheme.py
